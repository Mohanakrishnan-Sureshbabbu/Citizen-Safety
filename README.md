## Overview
This project integrates mobile devices with wearable BLE peripherals to enable users to send emergency alerts instantly. The system features seamless communication between mobile devices and peripherals, real-time geolocation tracking, and an intuitive interface for both end-users and authorities.  

The solution ensures fast and reliable emergency notifications, improving response times and overall citizen safety.

## Features
- **Real-time distress signaling:** Trigger alerts via wearable BLE devices or mobile app.
- **Sub-3 second GPS transmission:** Rapid location updates sent to contacts and authorities.
- **Dynamic geolocation display:** Interactive maps with route tracking and user location.
- **Reliable data ingestion:** Optimized PostgreSQL backend for efficient logging.
- **High reliability:** 99.9% data transmission accuracy.
- **Reduced response time:** Achieves over 40% faster response compared to SMS-based systems.

## Architecture
The system consists of three main components:

1. **Mobile Application**
   - Android app for users to send alerts and monitor safety status.
   - Communicates with BLE wearables for seamless distress signaling.
   - Uses Google Nearby API and Web Bluetooth API for device interactions.

2. **Backend**
   - PostgreSQL database for user and location data storage.
   - Optimized SQL queries for high-performance data ingestion.
   - REST API endpoints for mobile app and frontend communication.

3. **Frontend**
   - React.js web dashboard for monitoring user locations in real-time.
   - Integrated with Google Maps API for dynamic mapping and route visualization.
   - Displays real-time alerts and historical location data.

## Technologies Used
- **Mobile:** Android, Java/Kotlin, Google Nearby API, Web Bluetooth API
- **Frontend:** React.js, Google Maps API
- **Backend:** PostgreSQL, Node.js/Express (optional)
- **Communication:** BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
- **Others:** JavaScript, SQL
  
## Results & Evaluation
**Data Transmission Reliability**: Achieved 99.9% successful data delivery between BLE devices and the mobile app. **Emergency Response Time**: Reduced response times by over 40% compared to traditional SMS-based alert systems. **GPS Accuracy**: Sub-3 second transmission of user location data to authorities and designated contacts.
**User Experience**: Intuitive interface and minimal latency in alert triggering increased user engagement and confidence. **System Robustness**: Demonstrated stable operation under high-frequency alert scenarios with negligible downtime.

## Future Scope

-**Multi-platform Support**: Extend the mobile application to iOS devices. **AI-based Threat Analysis**: Integrate machine learning algorithms for predictive safety alerts. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Provide authorities with detailed analytics on emergency incidents. **Wearable Expansion**: Incorporate additional sensors (heart rate, fall detection) for automated alerts **Community Alerts**: Enable neighborhood-level emergency notifications and community assistance features. **Cloud Integration**: Move backend to cloud services for scalability and enhanced reliability.

## Performance
-**Data Transmission Reliability**: 99.9%. **Emergency Response Time Reduction**: >40% faster than SMS-based methods. **GPS Transmission**: Sub-3 second updates to designated contacts and authorities
